# Frontend coding challenge

Create a web app in which a user can search for a video using YouTube API. Feel free to use React, Vue, Angular or any other well-known web framework. 

The app should let users:

* Search for videos via keywords.
* It should show a list of matching results with video image/thumbnail and title of the video(Feel free to add more info).
* It should also have infinite scrolling.
* Feel free to make it awesome by using your creativity.

## Youtube API:
- Visit: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
- Use your google account to get the API key
- Docs: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs

## Rules:
* You are to create SPA using ReactJS/AngularJS/VueJS.
* Usage of external UI libraries such as Bootstrap, Material, Ant design etc is not allowed.
* Create your own CSS or style object for UI.
* Submitted code must build & run on Linux platforms.
* Submitted code will be reviewed for both functional and nonfunctional requirements such as code quality, ease of setting up it on local, testing scripts, etc.
* Your submission will be rejected if the test cases are missing.
* Responsive UI, PWA, hot reloading, minification etc will be a plus point.
* Don’t spend too much time on setting up build i.e. webpack config or stuff like that, feel free to use build tools like create-react-app ,  angular-cli, vue-cli to setup up a project. 

## How do I submit?
Create a git public repo and share the URL with us.
Readme file should contain setup, build & run instructions.
Please mention the node and npm version used while building the project.

## How do we evaluate?
- Simplicity, we value simplicity as an architectural virtue and a development practice. Solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and should not be overly complex. Layers of abstraction, patterns, or architectural features that aren’t called for should not be included.
- Self-explanatory code, the solution you produce must speak for itself. Multiple paragraphs explaining the solution are a sign that it isn’t straightforward enough to understand purely by reading code, and are not appropriate.
- Tests, should be around the requirements not around code. Eg. tests should read like “searching for cat should result in cat related videos” instead of “click on search button calls onClick handler”- basically avoid testing implementation details and focus on testing functionality.
